Newer versions of jest don't allow for the unhandledRejection handler being used in tests, because jest's handler cannot be overridden or unregistered.

This repo contains an example of some code that throws an Error in an async function that runs forever (seems contrived but in our production code this is a service that polls a message queue) and an accompanying test making sure that the code rejects in a way that the uncaught rejection handler is called, making sure that in production the service would shutdown.

There are two tagged commits with two different jest versions installed.

The commit tagged `broken` contains a newer version of jest where the test fails because jest handles the rejection and makes the test fail:

```sh
$ git checkout works && yarn && yarn test && git checkout master

Note: checking out 'works'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

The commit tagged `works` contains an older version of jest where this was testable:

```sh
$ git checkout broken && yarn && yarn test; git checkout master
